# Neovim Configuration

This is my personal neovim config. It is lightweight and supports LSP. 

## Installation

To use this config on macOS or Linux, simply clone into `~/.config/nvim`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lscherrer2/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

For Windows, clone into `~/AppData/Local/nvim`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lscherrer2/nvim.git ~/AppData/Local/nvim
```

## Customization & Plugins

You can use this as a starting point and add your own plugins. Simply add your lazy.nvim plugin 
spec to the `plugins/` folder.

Enjoy!
